      This Mexican casserole is easy to make and very tasty. I often substitute
      with ground turkey and low-fat dairy products, and it's still delicious!
      Serve this casserole with chips, salsa, and green salad.

    <h2>How to make mexican casserole</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-baking
        dish with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in
        the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in salsa, reduce heat, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, about
        20 minutes. Stir in beans; cook until heated through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread crushed tortilla chips over the bottom of the baking dish; spoon
        beef mixture on top. Spread sour cream over beef, then sprinkle olives,
        green onion, and tomatoes on top. Cover with Cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
