    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>
      You likely already have all the ingredients you'll need for this banana
      h4ead recipe on hand. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>flour</strong>: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread
        structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Baking soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which
        means it helps the banana bread rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salt</strong>: pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it
        won't make the loaf taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Butter</strong>: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and
        irresistible flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Brown Sugar </strong>: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a
        hint of warmth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they
        hold the batter together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>bananas</strong>: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose
        overripe bananas.
      </li>
    </ul>
